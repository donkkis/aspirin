# Confidence intervals for aspirin / placebo patients sustaining myocardial infarction

This is my reiteration from the infamous 1980's clinical trial studying acetylsalicylic acid’s (aspirin) possibility to reduce cardiovascular mortality.

The original trial featured 22 071 participants, out of which 11 037 were randomly assigned to receive a 325 mg dose of aspirin every other day, while the remaining 11 034 received placebo. The results, as reported in the original paper from 1989, display a 44 % reduction in risk of myocardial infarction (relative risk, 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.70; P<0.00001) in the aspirin group.

At present, two files are uploaded to the repository

aspirin_paho_report.pdf describes the methods used along with results and discussion

aspirin_paho.m includes the actual implementation in MATLAB
